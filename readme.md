## **Docker**
 ***

### Docker is a lightweight, open, and secure platform. It is a way to simplify the process of building, shipping, and running applications in a different environment. Docker bundles up all the dependencies of an application and runs it in a container. In a simple word, on the off chance that you need to use MSSQL, you do not need to download, install, and manage a bunch of packages, simply run the container with Docker and use it â€” as simple as that.
<br>

## **Image**
 ***

### An image is used to build a container, it has necessary files to run something on an operating system, like Windows or Ubuntu, and then it has your application framework along with database files that support that. So, if youâ€™re using ASP.NET, NodeJS, or Python, Images have that typical code.
<br>

## **Container**
 ***

### Images are just the definitions which cannot be run directly. To run the images, we need containers. Containers are the instances that help to run images with a different configuration like port, IP Address, etc.
<br>

## **Docker Compose**
 ***

### Docker Compose is used to run multiple containers under a single instance. It creates a network with different containers, through the network containers can communicate with each other. So, if the application has a dependency on other containers, Docker Compose is the right fit.
 
### As we tend to run a nopCommerce app with an MS SQL server, we'll use Docker Compose.
 
<br>

## **Assumptions**
 ***

### All commands in this post assume that -
    You are running a Linux machine.
    Docker is installed on your system.

<br>

## **Configuration**
 ***

    Open Source/nginx.conf and replace domain name with your domain name and change your host ip.

<br>

## **Grant permission**
 ***


    sudo chmod +x install.sh


<br>

## **Execution**
 ***

    sudo ./install.sh
<br>

## **Check Running Containers**
 ***

### It will list down all the running containers. You should see that both the containers - nopCommerce and SQL Server are running now.

<br>

## **Check the container status**
 ***

### Once the installation is done, you should see the connection reset page because our application container has stopped running.
